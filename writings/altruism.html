                    <p class="lead">Altruism is not a destination. It is not synonymous with love, nor is it the ideal
                        mindset.</p>

                    <p>To be clear, if one had to choose a guiding principle, "live altruistically" is generally a far
                        better choice than "live selfishly." In most cases, altruism brings about better outcomes in
                        one's personal life.</p>

                    <p>However, those who insist on blind, absolute altruism—who preach "always be selfless" without
                        room for nuance—are far more dangerous than those who advocate selfishness. At least the selfish
                        reveal something others can learn from. But the blindly altruistic hide behind masks of
                        goodness, showing hypocrisy, discomfort, and a kind of moral manipulation that ultimately pushes
                        others toward selfishness. It's more honest to live with one's true intentions than to conceal
                        them beneath a veneer of virtue.</p>

                    <p>Altruistic people often do not question their own beliefs. They live in imagined realities,
                        unaware of how their ideas might disturb others, believing their delusions to be truths. They
                        know they are perceived as good, and they play the part convincingly—soft-spoken, agreeable,
                        conflict-avoidant. They suppress disagreement under the guise of tolerance and shower others
                        with passive, hollow courtesy. People sense something off, but it's hard to challenge them.
                        Their image of kindness shields them from criticism, even when their presence feels unsettling.
                    </p>

                    <p>Compared to them, the openly selfish are more respectable, if only for their honesty. To avoid
                        becoming a hypocrite, one must understand the true nature and origin of altruism.</p>

                    <p>Selfishness isn't abstract or philosophical; it's visceral and real. It is the desire for
                        pleasure, comfort, safety—things that make our bodies feel good. When we are fed, rested, or
                        sexually gratified, we feel joy. When our bodies suffer, we feel miserable. This is universal.
                    </p>

                    <p>Altruism, in contrast, is not instinctive. It is taught. Human societies instill altruism through
                        moral education, religion, and social expectation. But these teachings function only if one
                        believes in, or submits to, ideals like divine will or rational duty—concepts that often remain
                        theoretical and disconnected from everyday experience.</p>

                    <p>This is why people often perceive moral preachers—who speak of altruism yet act selfishly—as
                        hypocrites. It's easier to admire someone honest about their selfishness than someone pretending
                        to be selfless.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, the foundation of altruistic behavior is selfishness. The motivation to make others
                        happy comes from our desire to feel good, to avoid guilt, to build meaningful relationships, to
                        achieve a sense of purpose or social reward. This doesn't taint altruism—it makes it
                        understandable. It is because we are selfish beings that we are capable of altruistic acts.
                        Self-interest is the root, the energy, and the biological foundation of our ability to care for
                        others.</p>

                    <p>Hunger and sexual desire are often seen as selfish impulses. That's true—they can lead to
                        negative consequences. But those same impulses are what allow us to live and reproduce. Without
                        hunger and sexual desire, we wouldn't exist in this world. Selfishness, then, is the
                        prerequisite for altruism. It is the wellspring of life itself.</p>

                    <p>Dividing selfishness and altruism into good and bad is reductive. Instead, we should speak of
                        wise selfishness and foolish selfishness. Wise selfishness considers long-term consequences,
                        evaluates risks, and acts for sustained happiness. Foolish selfishness seeks immediate gain at
                        the cost of future suffering—for oneself and others.</p>

                    <p>Foolish selfishness manifests in two main forms: blatant greed and performative altruism. People
                        who misunderstand love as merely emotional or moral goodness often conclude that caring for
                        others is right and caring for oneself is wrong. But every moral tradition, from Confucianism to
                        Christianity to Buddhism, ultimately links altruism to long-term personal well-being. To strip
                        altruism of self-interest is to misunderstand its essence.</p>

                    <p>Suppressing self-interest too much leads to psychological illness. Repression causes buried
                        desires to resurface as distorted behavior, disguised as virtue. People begin to fake altruism,
                        not out of love, but to satisfy their twisted needs for control, recognition, or self-worth.</p>

                    <p>History shows that most brutal acts of conquest, invasion, and genocide were committed in the
                        name of noble causes: justice, enlightenment, love, patriotism. Altruism, when unchecked, knows
                        no guilt. This doesn't mean altruism is evil, nor is selfishness. Nor should we claim there's no
                        difference between them. In fact, the notion that "everything is relative" is itself a danger—it
                        dilutes wisdom and erodes clarity.</p>

                    <p>As your understanding deepens, what once felt abstract or moralistic will reveal itself as
                        universal truth. When you see the world through love, it becomes lovable. When you act with
                        care, others begin to care in return.</p>

                    <p>In the end, we don't behave altruistically because it's righteous—we do it because we want to be
                        happy. The desire for serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin is natural. Self-interest is the most
                        human instinct we have, and it is also what enables us to build families, communities, and
                        meaning.</p>

                    <p>It is not wrong to seek simplicity in messaging for the public. The masses need digestible
                        truths. But behind that simplicity should be understanding—not delusion. It's time for honest,
                        selfish people to challenge fake altruism. Speak up. Be real. And remember: one who stands still
                        in this world will fall behind.</p>

                    <p>Choose your path with the long-term in mind. If your goal is happiness, then your method might
                        involve hardship today. But better to walk a hard path knowingly than to chase an easy one
                        blindly.</p>
