                        understand how I think, what I call the framework and logic of the world. It would be impossible
                        and a waste of time to directly jump to the next chapters, so I would be very grateful if you

                    <h2>FRAMEWORK 1</h2>
                    <p>In South Korea, students typically begin learning the peninsula’s earliest history with the
                        mythical founding of Go-Chosun in 2333 BCE. According to the Samguk Yusa*,Hwan-in, the “Lord of
                        Heaven”, permitted his son Hwan-ung to descend from the sky to Taebaeksan (now Mount Paektu
                        which is on the northern border of North Korea sharing with mainland China) with 3,000
                        followers, among them three heavenly ministers of clouds, rain, and wind. There, Hwan-ung taught
                        humans laws, medicine, agriculture, and moral codes.</p>
                    <p>One day, as Hwan-ung was walking in the woods, he met a tiger and a bear. The tiger and the bear
                        begged Hwan-ung they wish to become human. Hwanung told the bear and the tiger that if they
                        secluded themselves in a dark cave for one hundred days, never letting in a ray of light, and
                        lived only on mugwort and garlic, they would be transformed into human beings. The tiger and
                        bear both follow Hwan-ung’s words, yet the tiger runs away from the cave on the 20th day, being
                        sick of not getting sunlight and the vegan diet. The bear makes it through, and on the 100th day
                        the bear becomes a female human. Hwan-ung marries this now lady-formerly-bear, named “Oong-nyeo”
                        which literally means bear woman. They have a child, named Dan-gun. In 2333 BCE he established
                        Gojoseon in the northern Korean peninsula (today’s North Korea–China border region). The date of
                        Dan-gun’s ascension (October 3), is celebrated each year as Gaecheonjeol (개천절), literally
                        “Opening of Heaven Day” or “Revealing of the Sky.” This is the beginning of the first nation in
                        the Korean Peninsula, “Go-Chosun.” Dan-gun himself called it Chosun, though historians refer to
                        this early state as Go-Chosun (“Ancient Chosun”).</p>
                    <p><em>* The Samguk Yusa was written in the late 13th century, around 1281, by the Buddhist monk
                            Iryeon during the Goryeo dynasty. It is NOT the most modern, scientific based writing.</em>
                    </p>

                    <h2>FRAMEWORK 2</h2>
                    <p>In Korea, there aren’t a wide variety of last names. However, you can pre-date your first
                        ancestors to a very long time ago. Our family origins begin with founders who pop out of eggs,
                        glow in the dark, or stride down from clouds, and those origin scripts still stamp today’s
                        phonebooks with a handful of colossal surnames.</p>
                    <p>Take Go. Goguryeo’s founder Jumong hatches from an egg after his mother is impregnated by a beam
                        of sunlight; every Go clan that followed claimed his skylit shell as proof of heavenly mandate.
                        South of Goguryeo was Silla. The man who founded Silla was Park Hyeokgeose: a boy inside an egg
                        that shimmers like polished copper, cracks open beside a sacred well, and immediately radiates
                        light so bright the villagers drop to their knees. From that cracking egg comes every Park
                        (Korean, obviously) you know today. Same as Go.</p>
                    <p>The most common last name, Kim, sprouts two branches, both Amazon Prime box-fresh from the
                        heavens.</p>
                    <p>Around 65 CE (the 9th year of King Talhae’s reign) a strange cry echoed west of the Silla
                        capital. Talhae dispatched his minister Hogong to Sirim Forest. There, hanging from an ancient
                        branch, was a small golden chest bathed in light; beneath it a white rooster kept crowing. The
                        chest was brought to court and, when opened, revealed an infant of unusual radiance. Delighted,
                        the king adopted the child and named him Kim (which means “gold”) Alji (read phonetically as
                        “Alti/Alji,” often means “clever” or “bright”) which means “the wise one born from gold.” Sirim
                        Forest was renamed Gyerim (“Rooster Grove”), and “Gyerim” even became an early poetic name for
                        Silla itself. Although Alji never ruled, his descendants, starting with King Michu (262- 284
                        CE), turned the Kim clan into Silla’s longest-serving royal house, a lineage millions of Koreans
                        still trace today.</p>

                    <p>The other Kim branch comes from Suro Kim. Kim Suro’s origin story is pure stagecraft, and it
                        worked. In 42 CE, say the Samguk Yusa and the now-lost Garakgukgi, nine village chiefs gathered
                        on Gujibong Peak to pray when a gold bowl wrapped in red cloth spiraled down on a purple cord
                        from the sky. Inside lay six golden eggs. After twelve days the shells split, revealing six
                        towering boys. The first stood up, announced Heaven’s command, and took the name Suro (which
                        means “firstborn”). He crowned himself king of Geumgwan Gaya (literally “Gold-Crown Gaya”) and
                        adopted the surname Kim (“gold”), while the other five brothers became rulers of satellite Gaya
                        states. Even lesser-known Ijinasi of Daegaya strolls out of one of those six shells as if the
                        sky were a giant incubator. Now let me explain what I am trying to get across in these Framework
                        1 and 2.</p>

                    <h3>Framework Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Nobody in Korea takes the “son of god” or “opening of heavens” as a historical, factual text,
                        thinking “yes, Hwanung literally ran a 100-day vegan detox clinic for bears”. Nobody believes
                        that “Oong-nyu” was actually a bear who turned into a woman. The same goes for Kim Alji’s golden
                        chest and Kim Suro’s six sky-eggs. They are political manifestos dressed up as bedtime tales.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is for multiple reasons. First, you can’t scientifically explain these processes. If I lock
                        up a bear in a cave and gave it veggies for 100 days, I’m pretty sure it will die of
                        malnutrition, not getting a hot future wife for me. I can’t fly an airplane into the heavens to
                        meet the 3 gods that Dan-gun brought and ask if they can snow one day to get snow day. Not a
                        single human is known to be born in an egg—we’re mammals.</p>
                    <p>But there are parts that are scientifically challenging that people believe in. I’m no
                        Christianity expert, but there are people who do believe that Jesus walked on water, gave food
                        to thousands of people using only five loaves and two fish. The biggest difference comes from
                        how historians have interpreted these legends, backing up with historical evidence.</p>
                    <p>Many historians now locate Dangun’s tribe in the Liaodong–Manchuria corridor, the northwestern
                        edge of the Korean peninsula extending into today’s Liaoning Province of China.</p>
                    <p>Before Dan-gun came, there were 2 main tribes: a tribe who worshipped bears as their gods and
                        another tribe that worshipped tigers as their gods. Dan-gun’s tribe allied with the bear tribe
                        and defeated the tiger tribe. This is what the legend of Dan-gun marrying a former bear, current
                        woman Oong-nyu.</p>
                    <p>The three gods Dangun brought each symbolized a critical leap forward: mastery of agriculture,
                        ritual control over the weather, and the use of bronze. By contrast, the peninsula’s earlier
                        communities, what archaeologists call the polished-stone cultures (Jeulmun (c. 8000 – 1500 BCE)
                        and early Mumun pottery periods), relied on ground-stone tools, cord-marked pottery, and
                        animistic totems carved in wood and bone. Bronze appears centuries after the 2333 BCE founding
                        date, but when archaeologists find bronze mirrors in tombs, they trace them to the Liaodong
                        trade network that later influenced early Korean polities. They venerated bears, tigers, rivers,
                        and mountains as living spirits (animism), organized themselves around clan totems (totemism),
                        and consulted shamans (shamanism) to mediate with unseen forces.</p>
                    <p>Dangun’s people, however, pioneered the jehsa ceremony. Led by the chief, a jehsa gathered the
                        whole tribe before a laid-out table of food offerings and bronze mirrors, invoked the sky-gods,
                        and pleaded for rain, sunshine, or mild winds. When drought threatened the crops, Dangun would
                        call another jehsa until the clouds answered. This ritual survives in modified form among modern
                        Korean families, a living echo of those first sky-calling rites. Remember that “jehsa” when we
                        turn to family practices in the next chapter.</p>
                    <p>These historic analyses are only available thanks to the ruins that archaeologists have
                        discovered. The oldest bronze materials pre-date up to Dan-gun’s era, and they aren’t only
                        limited to military equipment. One of the most important uses of bronze was the mirror, which
                        was used during the jeh-sa. There are dozens of pieces of evidence of all the different
                        spiritualities that existed before Dan-gun, categorized in “Animism, Totemism, etc”. It is
                        believed that these tribes did not have as big of a size as Go-Chosun, and they also didn’t
                        survive as long.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the first Go being born from an egg, historians believe that this means a symbolic
                        assertion of heavenly mandate to legitimate his rule and unify rival clans. It was a story made
                        for peasants to believe that this man is divine, so that they would obey without questioning.
                    </p>
                    <p>What about the chest and rooster in the story of Kim Alji? Modern historians see the whole scene
                        as a kind of symbolic political message. A box of gold represents both heavenly approval and
                        real-world wealth: powerful symbols if Silla was trying to welcome a skilled group of immigrants
                        known for their metalworking. Some scholars even link the name “Alji” or “Alti” to the Altaic
                        word altin, which means “gold.” The rooster, crowing at dawn, fits into a wider pattern of
                        sun-worship seen across Eurasia and signals that this child’s arrival marks a new beginning for
                        the kingdom. By adopting the child rather than claiming him as a royal heir, King Talhae could
                        bring this gold-carrying outsider into the royal bloodline without upsetting the older Park and
                        Seok families. At the same time, he could still claim that the kingdom’s right to rule came from
                        the heavens, not just family connections. In the end, Kim Alji’s origin story was not really
                        about how babies are born. It was a way to announce a new political alliance, dressed up in
                        divine symbols. That message helped Kim kings rule Silla for almost six hundred years.</p>
                    <p>The symbolism regarding Kim Suro’s birth is loud but coherent. Gold/metal signals the Gaya
                        league’s iron-working wealth; red cloth and sunrise timing pull in sun-cult imagery; the six
                        eggs neatly map onto the “Six Gaya” polities the confederacy was trying to weld together. By
                        claiming he had no human parents, Suro erased any rival bloodlines and presented his kingship as
                        a direct assignment from Heaven. It made him politically untouchable in a frontier region
                        surrounded by competing local chiefs.</p>
                    <p>The legend then folds in foreign diplomacy. At sixteen, a ship with Princess Heo Hwangok of
                        “Ayuta” (many historians link the name to India’s Ayodhya) docks at Gaya. She says Heaven
                        ordered her to marry Suro. Modern scholars treat her arrival as a maritime-trade memory: Gaya’s
                        iron ingots reached Japan, and Indian Ocean goods were filtering up the China coast, so a royal
                        marriage myth dramatizes long-distance commerce and confers exotic prestige.</p>
                    <p>So, like Kim Alji’s rooster-lit chest, Kim Suro’s six-egg origin story is not about zoology. It
                        is a political message wrapped in symbolism of Heaven’s approval, a tribal alliance, and a trade
                        route announcement all combined into one.</p>
                    <p>These interpretations aren’t “rude” or “denying my origin”. It would be misleading for me to
                        believe that Hwan-ung actually rode a cloud from heaven down to earth in the Korean peninsula.
                        It would be misleading to believe that his wife was actually a bear and became human by doing a
                        vegan diet in a cave. That is definitely not the point that my ancestors wanted to get across.
                        If they come back to life in 2025, they would be relieved to know that nobody is actually
                        interpreting their story as “oh, back in BC 2333 if you go in a cave and do a vegan diet for 100
                        days, you could turn an animal into human”. It would be quite absurd to convince someone that
                        this is factual, and if someone is gullible enough to do it in the modern day, he probably would
                        try to do it to his own pet in a random cave. The “literal text” doesn’t have any weight, as it
                        is a story that our ancestors made up for multiple reasons, mainly as a political toolkit.</p>
                    <p>This is the end of the “training” you need to read the next chapter. Now you have the tools to
                        understand how I think, and the conclusions I have come to.</p>

                    <h2>Christianity</h2>
                    <p>Until 2023, I thought that all Christians were mentally ill. The Christians I interacted with
                        went to church because they wanted to go to heaven. They were afraid to go to hell. They
                        convinced me that I must do the same, because they didn’t want their friend to go to hell,
                        because I didn’t go to church. As a 21st century man whose major is physics, I thought the
                        antonym of science was Christianity.</p>
                    <p>Christians told me that this Jesus guy walked on water, gave his body and blood to his friends to
                        eat, the first woman was born from a man’s rib bone, and that snakes talked at that time. In
                        addition, people used to live hundreds of years, and God created everything. Nobody could give
                        me a scientifically acceptable, sane-sounding answer to “so who created god?” The most basic
                        questions were not answered in an understandable and logical manner. On top of that, they would
                        point fingers at me as if I’m the man who killed Jesus. I just don’t believe in the same fugazi
                        that you do, bro. It’s not that serious.</p>
                    <p>It was around May of 2023 when I came to realize that the Bible might just be in the same format
                        as these myths and legends that were taught in history textbooks in Korea. I was spending time
                        reading Herman Hesse, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jordan Peterson. Things started making sense. If
                        the Bible is taken as a “book of stories and myths that have underlying messages”, not a
                        “factual history book of humanity”, I could completely understand it.</p>
                    <p>I haven’t read the Bible verse by verse, and I’m pretty sure that I know less than 5% of the
                        Bible. If you are Christian, the words I have just said and will be saying might anger you, but
                        please show mercy and follow along with me because I have a message specifically for you, and a
                        thank you note as well. If you consider yourself an atheist, I hope these words enlighten you to
                        understand Christians: they’re not insane. In any case, you can consider me a lunatic and
                        completely disregard my words. If that happens, I apologize and thank you in advance for
                        spending your precious time reading this.</p>

                    <h3>My Opinion on Christianity</h3>
                    <p>Jesus was born from a Virgin. This is the Christian version of the “first last name of Go from
                        egg” story. It shows that this man was “divine”. Jesus lived a pretty rough life. He had to go
                        through constant ridicule, persecution, and ultimately crucifixion. Now I want to reflect back
                        on your own life. Count the days you felt pain. Count the number of harsh and devastating events
                        that happened in your life. It can be anywhere from your dog passing away to being mistreated in
                        work or school. Life itself is unfair. If you’re five years old, you might feel this unfairness
                        in a race between friends, where you practiced for hours every day to be fast but you’re still
                        slower than your friend who is just born with talent. If you’re 18, you might think that you
                        tried very hard in academics but you didn’t get into your dream school. If you’re 30, you might
                        be noticing that life is a series of painful events: someone who you thought was going to be
                        your wife cheats on you, at work you try extremely hard but a random dude who clearly seems to
                        be a nepo baby gets the raise and promotion, and your dog just died. What would your response to
                        “life” be if you noticed that life is just a series of horrible events?</p>
                    <p>I believe that the Bible gives people a good guideline. Jesus was an amazing guy, He spread love
                        to the world, he healed sick people and fed the poor. Even when He was mistreated, even when
                        justice wasn’t on His side, even when He wasn’t getting the credit He deserved, He did not stop
                        to help humanity. Even while He was being crucified, Jesus prayed for those who were executing
                        Him and forgave the repentant thief beside Him. So, let’s apply this lesson into our lives. Why
                        don’t we live like Jesus? Our lives so far have been very unjust and unfair. It’s probably a
                        delusion to believe that our future is going to be completely fair and just. So why don’t we
                        live like Jesus? Not only did I start accepting the unjust and unfair nature of life, but I also
                        started becoming open to be a better man to others, even when I was going through harsh times
                        and was heavily mistreated. Then, I realized something. The “heaven and hell” that the Bible
                        refers to is regarding this current life, not a literal location in the afterlife.</p>
