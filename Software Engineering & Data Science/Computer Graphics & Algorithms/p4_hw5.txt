Explanation

I started by researching many different ways to draw this shape, finding algorithms like "boundary fill",
 "Bresenham's Line Algorithm," and the "line scan algorithm." I wanted to try the "line scan algorithm," 
but it was very complicated and challenging. I decided to go with a simpler method based on the three 
points from the EPS file. My plan was to color 20 pixels above the base, 20 pixels to the left of the 
height, and 20 pixels below the hypotenuse. The most important part was the hypotenuse, as its thickness 
had to be 20 pixels measured perpendicularly. To do this, I had to calculate the cosine of the angle. Since
 the slope is 3/4 (for every 4 units I move right, I move 3 units up), the cosine is 4/5, or 0.8. This meant
 the vertical thickness I needed to check for was actually 20 / 0.8 = 25 pixels.

To implement this, I created an all-white 512x409 canvas and used nested for loops to check every single 
pixel (x, y). I colored blue only if it passed a two-part test. First, it had to be part of one of those 
three thick edge bands (0<=y<=20 for the base, 380<=x<=400 for the right edge, or 
y_hyp -25<=y<=y_hyp for the hypotenuse). Second, it also had to be inside the triangle's boundaries, which
 I checked with y >= 0, x <= 400, and y <= slope * x. I'm aware this method is highly inefficient because 
it checks all 209,408 pixels, but it correctly implemented the geometric logic. I couldn't find a better way.
