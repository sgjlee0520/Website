    "### Question 1: Photon Energies for Shortest and Longest Visible Wavelengths\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the information from the Overview and Equation 1 to find the photon energies corresponding to the shortest and longest wavelengths visible by the cone cells in the typical human eye. The document states that the human eye, under photopic vision, responds to wavelengths between $430 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ and $680 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$, where efficiency drops to about 1% at these limits. Equation 1, $E_\\gamma = \\frac{1240}{\\lambda(\\mathrm{nm})} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, provides the energy of a photon in electron-volts (eV) given its wavelength in nanometers (nm), using the conversion constant $\\hbar c = 197.3 \\, \\mathrm{eV} \\cdot \\mathrm{nm}$ scaled appropriately. First, I calculated the energy for the shortest visible wavelength, $\\lambda = 430 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$: $E_\\gamma = \\frac{1240}{430} \\approx 2.88 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. Next, I computed the energy for the longest visible wavelength, $\\lambda = 680 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$: $E_\\gamma = \\frac{1240}{680} \\approx 1.82 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. These calculations confirm that the photon energies range from approximately 1.82 eV to 2.88 eV across the visible spectrum detectable by cone cells. I noted that very bright sources just outside this range might be faintly visible, but for this lab, I’ll focus on the specified 430–680 nm range, which aligns with the Spencer spectrometer’s capabilities."

    "### Question 2: Photon Energies and Wavelengths for $H_\\alpha$, $H_\\beta$, and $H_\\gamma$\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with Equation 7, $E_\\gamma = 13.6 \\, \\mathrm{eV} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)$, to compute the photon energies for the hydrogen emission lines $H_\\alpha$, $H_\\beta$, and $H_\\gamma$, where the Balmer series has $n_f = 2$, and the initial states are $n_i = 3, 4, 5$ respectively. For $H_\\alpha$ ($n_i = 3$, $n_f = 2$): $E_\\gamma = 13.6 \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{3^2} \\right) = 13.6 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{9} \\right) = 13.6 \\left( 0.25 - 0.111 \\right) = 13.6 \\times 0.139 \\approx 1.89 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. For $H_\\beta$ ($n_i = 4$, $n_f = 2$): $E_\\gamma = 13.6 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{16} \\right) = 13.6 \\left( 0.25 - 0.0625 \\right) = 13.6 \\times 0.1875 \\approx 2.55 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. For $H_\\gamma$ ($n_i = 5$, $n_f = 2$): $E_\\gamma = 13.6 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{25} \\right) = 13.6 \\left( 0.25 - 0.04 \\right) = 13.6 \\times 0.21 \\approx 2.86 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. Next, I used Equation 1, $E_\\gamma = \\frac{1240}{\\lambda(\\mathrm{nm})} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, to find the wavelengths. For $H_\\alpha$: $\\lambda = \\frac{1240}{1.89} \\approx 656 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$. For $H_\\beta$: $\\lambda = \\frac{1240}{2.55} \\approx 486 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$. For $H_\\gamma$: $\\lambda = \\frac{1240}{2.86} \\approx 434 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$. These wavelengths fall within the 430–680 nm visible range, confirming they are observable with the Spencer spectrometer. I double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy, noting that these values align with the Balmer series expectations, and I’m excited to measure them in the lab."

    "### Question 3: Transitions Contributing to $H_\\alpha$, $H_\\beta$, and $H_\\gamma$\n",
    "\n",
    "I examined Figure 2 (the hydrogen term diagram) to identify the transitions contributing to the visible Balmer series lines $H_\\alpha$, $H_\\beta$, and $H_\\gamma$, where $n_f = 2$. The document highlights one transition for $H_\\alpha$ shown in red, which is $3p$ to $2s$, and I need to draw the other two contributing transitions for $H_\\alpha$ and list all transitions for the three lines. For $H_\\alpha$ ($n_i = 3$ to $n_f = 2$), the allowed transitions follow the $\\Delta \\ell = 1$ selection rule. This rule, the $\\Delta \\ell = \\pm 1$ selection rule, governs electric dipole transitions by ensuring angular momentum conservation. This rule allows transitions where the orbital angular momentum $\\ell$ changes by $\\pm 1$ (e.g., $p \\to s$ or $d \\to p$), but forbids changes like $s \\to s$ or $d \\to d$. I am reading Griffith's right now, and in the angular momentum part it taught me this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides $3p$ to $2s$, I identified $3d$ to $2p$ (since $\\ell = 2$ to $\\ell = 1$) and $3s$ to $2p$ (since $\\ell = 0$ to $\\ell = 1$), which I’ll draw as diagonal lines on the figure. For $H_\\beta$ ($n_i = 4$ to $n_f = 2$), the transitions are $4p$ to $2s$, $4d$ to $2p$, and $4f$ to $2p$ (since $\\ell = 0, 1, 2$ to $\\ell = 1$ or 0 with $\\Delta \\ell = 1$). For $H_\\gamma$ ($n_i = 5$ to $n_f = 2$), the transitions are $5p$ to $2s$, $5d$ to $2p$, $5f$ to $2p$, and $5g$ to $2p$ (since $\\ell = 0$ to 3 to $\\ell = 1$ or 0 with $\\Delta \\ell = 1$). The total number of transitions is the sum: 3 for $H_\\alpha$, 3 for $H_\\beta$, and 4 for $H_\\gamma$, totaling 10 transitions. My list of transitions in usual notation is: $3p \\to 2s$, $3d \\to 2p$, $3s \\to 2p$ (for $H_\\alpha$); $4p \\to 2s$, $4d \\to 2p$, $4f \\to 2p$ (for $H_\\beta$); $5p \\to 2s$, $5d \\to 2p$, $5f \\to 2p$, $5g \\to 2p$ (for $H_\\gamma$). I’ll turn in the annotated figure with these transitions marked, ensuring the $\\Delta \\ell = 1$ rule is followed, which excites me as I prepare to see these lines in the lab."
